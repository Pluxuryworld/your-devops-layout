                        <h4>Cloud</h4>
                        <p>All modern companies are either cloud-native or in the process of migrating to the
                            cloud. It doesn't
                            matter which cloud provider you use, but it does matter that you have the knowledge and
                            expertise to
                            use
                            it the right way. Your DevOps Mentor will teach you how to create and automate cloud
                            projects. In
                            your
                            individualized, one-on-one sessions with your mentor, you will develop the skills to master
                            the
                            cloud
                            functionalities necessary for modern company needs. We support all major cloud platforms,
                            including
                            AWS,
                            GCP, and Azure. Terraform is our favorite automation tool.</p>

                        <h4>Monitoring</h4>
                        <p>It's essential for you as a DevOps engineer to understand your environment. You are the
                            front-line team member ensuring smooth and efficient functionality, identifying any issues,
                            and intervening manually when needed. Awareness is key; this is where monitoring
                            technologies come in. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK can be used to collect
                            metrics, visualize and analyze them, and establish proper alerting rules. Your mentor will
                            support you in learning these monitoring technologies.</p>

                        <p>Kubernetes and Docker are not the future—they are already here. Containers have jumped into
                            the scene as key parts of the DevOps field. Container knowledge is now industry standard and
                            required for 89% of the jobs in the industry. Success in this market means embracing the
                            trend and mastering container technologies. Not sure where to start? Your DevOps Mentor will

                        <p>Developers need an easy way to create, test, and deploy applications. This is where CICD
                            pipelines become an essential tool in your toolkit. A typical pipeline uses Jenkins to pull
                            code from GitHub, build artifacts, and deploy applications to production. This mentorship is
                            your chance to learn how to design effective CICD pipelines as you create and test

                            allow you to practice your new skills and receive feedback. Your mentor will assign a
                            project, assist if something goes wrong, and provide a code review upon completion. You will
                            work on multiple projects throughout the program. Not only do these help you master your
                            skills, but they also serve as tangible demonstrations of your work that you can later use

                            You’ll then work together to prepare for real interview situations by conducting mock
